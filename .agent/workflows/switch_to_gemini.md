description: Switch Chatbot Backend to Gemini Fully
---

To switch the chatbot backend from Botpress to Gemini, follow these steps:

1.  Remove Botpress dependencies and logic from `Chatbot.jsx`.
    // turbo
    ```bash
    # This step is handled by the agent manually for code changes.
    echo "Please ask the agent to apply the code changes to Chatbot.jsx."
    ```

2.  Verify the `chatbotRoutes.js` is updated (already done).
